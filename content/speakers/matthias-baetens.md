I am a graduate engineer in Computer Sciences and Advanced Master in Marketing Analysis. I am highly motivated and have a broad palette of interests, but a strong passion for technology, business and the combination of these two. I am eager to learn and strive for excellence, but at the same time try to keep an open view on the world. At the same time, I have a strong urge to travel and work abroad.
