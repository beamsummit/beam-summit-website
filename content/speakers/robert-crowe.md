 A data scientist and TensorFlow addict, Robert has a passion for helping developers quickly learn what they need to be productive. He's used TensorFlow since the very early days and is excited about how it's evolving quickly to become even better than it already is. Before moving to data science Robert led software engineering teams for both large and small companies, always focusing on clean, elegant solutions to well-defined needs. In his spare time Robert sails, surfs occasionally, and raises a family.
