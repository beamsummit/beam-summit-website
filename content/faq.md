## How can I watch the sessions?
When the event starts, we will have a [Live](/live) page in this site where you will be able to watch the sessions (or if you prefer, you can go directly to the crowdcast at https://crowdcast.io/e/beamsummit). 
* If you are already registered to the Beam Summit and have an active session on Crowdcast, you should be able to see the live session (or the latest recording if there is none live at the moment).
* If you don't have an active session on the Beam Summit crowdcast, click on the "Join" button within the crowdcast and follow the instructions.

## Does participation have a cost?
Participation in Beam Summit is completely free. You can register for free and watch all sesions.

## How can I interact with other participants?
We will be using a slack workspace for interaction between participants. We will soon provide the details.

## Will sessions be recorded?
All sessions will be recorded. They will be available in two stages with different qualities:
* A few minutes after each session is finished, recordings will be available for viewing directly in Crowdcast. In order to watch a recording of a previous session in Crowdcast, click on the SCHEDULE (upper left corner within the Crowdcast window) and select the session you want. The downside to this recorded version is that it may have "dead time" before the actual start of the talk, plus the audio may not have the best quality.
* At most one week after each talk is performed, we will upload an edited+cleaned version of the recording to the [Apache Beam YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChNnb_YO_7B0HlW6FhAXZZQ).

### Is there a code of conduct?
Yes. You can review it [here](/coc).
