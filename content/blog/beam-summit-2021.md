Beam Summit is returning for 2021 as an online and free event, happening on August 4-6, 2021.

The call for papers is now available at https://sessionize.com/beam-digital-summit-2021/

We are looking for speakers that can provide technical insights, but also for people that can tell interesting stories on how and where Apache Beam is used.

### Ways to participate and help
As all things Beam, this is a community effort. The door is open for participation:

1. Submit a proposal to talk. Please check out the [Call for Papers](https://sessionize.com/beam-digital-summit-2021/) and submit a talk.
2. [Register](https://crowdcast.io/e/beamsummit2021) to join as an attendee. It is free!
3. Consider sponsoring the event. If your company is interested in engaging with members of the community please check out our sponsoring [prospectus](https://beamsummit.org/files/BeamSummit-Prospectus.pdf).
4. Help us get the word out. Please make sure to let your colleagues and friends in the data engineering field (and beyond!) know about the Beam Summit.
