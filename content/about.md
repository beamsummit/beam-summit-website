Beam Summit 2020 is an online conference for the worldwide community of Apache Beam users and contributors. The event dates are August 24th to August 28th, 2020.

### Activities & content
We are planning to have talks that will dive on different topics like how is Apache Beam evolving and what is in the roadmap, how are companies using it, and how can we strengthen our community. In addition to talks, we are considering also having hands-on workshops.
