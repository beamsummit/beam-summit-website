When the event starts, we will have a Live page in this site where you will be able to watch the sessions (or if you prefer, you can go directly to the crowdcast at https://crowdcast.io/e/beamsummit2021).\n If you are already registered to the Beam Summit and have an active session on Crowdcast, you should be able to see the live session (or the latest recording if there is none live at the moment). If you don\u0026rsquo;t have an active session on the Beam Summit crowdcast, click on the \u0026ldquo;Join\u0026rdquo; button within the crowdcast and follow the instructions.  Does participation have a cost? Participation in Beam Summit is completely free. You can register for free and watch all sesions.\nHow can I interact with other participants? We will be using slack to interact with speakers and other participants. Please join the #beam-summit-attendees channel in the ASF slack workspace. If you need to create an account, please click here so that you can create an account without an invitation or ASF email.\nWill sessions be recorded? All sessions will be recorded. They will be available in two stages with different qualities:\n A few minutes after each session is finished, recordings will be available for viewing directly in Crowdcast. In order to watch a recording of a previous session in Crowdcast, click on the SCHEDULE (upper left corner within the Crowdcast window) and select the session you want. The downside to this recorded version is that it may have \u0026ldquo;dead time\u0026rdquo; before the actual start of the talk, plus the audio may not have the best quality. At most one week after each talk is performed, we will upload an edited+cleaned version of the recording to the Apache Beam YouTube channel.  Is there a code of conduct? Yes.

Instead, we will focus on the real-world complexity that comes from simply moving data from one system to another safely. How do we model data as it passes from one transform to another? How do we handle errors? How do we test the system? How do we organize the code to make the pipeline configurable for different source and destination systems?\nWe will explore how each of these questions are addressed in Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s open source codebase for ingesting telemetry data from Firefox clients. By the end of the session, you\u0026rsquo;ll be equipped to explore the codebase and documentation on your own to see how these concepts are composed together.\n","permalink":"https://2021.beamsummit.org/sessions/nitty-gritty-moving-data-with-beam/","tags":null,"title":"The nitty-gritty of moving data with Beam"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Real world machine learning systems are comprised of a small amount of actual ML code surrounded by a vast infrastructure - most of which revolves around manipulating and handling data.\nIn this hands-on workshop we will work through an end-to-end example of using the Python Beam SDK to build maintainable, reliable, and scalable production pipelines for deep learning.\nWe will begin by taking time series data from a warehouse like BigQuery and, through Beam, engineer features using common data science libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, then transform the data into TFRecords. We will train an RNN using these TFRecords and finally use the same Beam pipeline to perform inference.\nBy the end you will be able to kickstart using Beam for your own ML applications!\n","permalink":"https://2021.beamsummit.org/sessions/workshop-building-big-data-pipelines/","tags":null,"title":"Workshop: Building big data pipelines for deep learning"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This workshop is for participants who are getting started with Apache Beam.\nApache Beam is an open source unified model for defining data processing pipelines (Batch and strEAM), which allows you to write your pipeline in your language of choice and run it with minimal effort on the execution engine (ex: Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Google Cloud Dataflow) of choice. In this practical session we will get hands-on writing Beam pipelines, and as well as discuss the fundamentals of Beam programming model, and SDKs (Python, Go, Java, Kotlin).\nPrerequisites You will need to install IntelliJ IDEA and/or PyCharm with the EduTools plugin, and with the kata(s) installed in the language of their choice to work through exercises in the online platform.
