## Overview
This repo contains the code and data for the [Beam Summit website](beamsummit.org) and is based on [Project Hoverboard](https://github.com/gdg-x/hoverboard) created by the [GDG Lviv](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Lviv/) team.

## HOW TO USE (see much from below).
Structure:
* Master branch will be used to keep up-to-date with Hoverboard
* needing to add a 'main'/'landing-page' branch which will be a to-be-developed landing page
* branches will exist for each summit
* Each branch will be used to setup independant auto-build processes.
