**Why community engagement matters**
 Why we need a strong Apache Beam community: 
 - We're gaining lots of code contributions and need committers to review them.
 - We want people to feel a sense of ownership to the project. By fostering this level of engagement, the work becomes even more exciting.
 - A healthy community has a further reach and leads to more growth. More hours can be contributed to the project as we can spread the work and ownership.
 
 Why are we organizing these summits: 
 - Weâ€™d like to give folks a place to meet, congregate, and share ideas.
 - We know that offline interactions often changes the nature of the online ones in a positive manner.
 - Building an active and diverse community is part of the Apache Way. These summits provide an opportunity for us to engage people from different locations, companies, and backgrounds.
