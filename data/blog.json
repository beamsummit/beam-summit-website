By fostering this level of engagement, the work becomes even more exciting.<br> - A healthy community has a further reach and leads to more growth. More hours can be contributed to the project as we can spread the work and ownership.<br> <br> Why are we organizing these summits: <br> - Weâ€™d like to give folks a place to meet, congregate, and share ideas.<br> - We know that offline interactions often changes the nature of the online ones in a positive manner.<br> - Building an active and diverse community is part of the Apache Way. These summits provide an opportunity for us to engage people from different locations, companies, and backgrounds.<br>"
